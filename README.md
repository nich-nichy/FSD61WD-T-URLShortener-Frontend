# What is a Url shortner 
A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL (web address) and converts it into a shorter, more compact version while still directing users to the original destination. It's useful for making URLs easier to share, especially on platforms with character limits like Twitter or for tracking user engagement.
Example: A long URL like 

```
https://www.example.com/some/really/long/path?file+to+html&oq=how+to+add+a+css+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIGCAcQRRg80gEIMzcwMmowajeoAgiwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
```

Might become

```
